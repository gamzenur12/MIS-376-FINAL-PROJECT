Covid-19's Impact on Unemployment

In this project, I will explain the effect of covid-19 on the unemployment rate in our country. 
Many workplaces were closed due to Covid-19 and workers were removed from the workplace. 
Compared to previous years, unemployment increased significantly in the covid-19 period. 
I got some data about this from CDC numbers and DISK-AR sources. I will explain this data on the chart and transfer it to you.
